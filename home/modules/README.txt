structure is: 
            Packages/ contains all packages that i have installed but where i have nodefined my own config, or for the time beeing, the config is a few lines.

            all other folders are aplication spesific configs.
            the entrypoint for all is default.nix and then <name>_config.nix is the main file. this is for easier fzf search.
